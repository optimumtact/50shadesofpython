This is a generator based on the https://github.com/50shadesgen/50shadesgen written in javascript

I've converted it to python (targetted to python3) and the vocab and sentence list was included as json instead

Example outputs can be found on the original website (nsfw) http://www.fiftyshadesgenerator.com/
